Please note that we have freeze state on adding new features till v1.0 release.
Anyway, any new feature suggestion is welcome and you are free to draft a PR,
 but be aware that several refactoring will take place for this major release yielding in significant collision solving.
A recommendation for feature draft is draw just outline, do not implement all details and propagate the changes to codebase...
